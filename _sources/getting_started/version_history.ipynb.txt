    "## 0.0.44 - 16th of May 2022\n",
    "This version is a cleanup of the syntax and streamlining of the package. It improves the consistency of the language use, removes unused methods and is better at recognizing when wrong input is made.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Renaming of methods to make the \"show\" verb in method names more consistent.\n",
    "    - show_components did show all available McStas components, now shows components in current instrument\n",
    "    - print_components still shows all components in current instrument, but also a warning pointing to show_instrument as best practice\n",
    "    - available_components now shows all available McStas components for help purposes\n",
    "- Moved away from allowing arbitrary keyword arguments in some places, so it is now an error to misspell keyword arguments.\n",
    "    - Instrument initialization\n",
    "    - Instrument.settings method\n",
    "    - Instrument.show_components (and print_components) methods\n",
    "    - Component initialization\n",
    "- Removed instrument methods for manipulating components like set_component_AT() as they provided an additional way of doing the same thing, but more error prone than working with the component objects directly.\n",
    "- Moved widgets out of base import of package to speed up import\n",
    "- Widgets for Jupyter notebooks now loaded with: \n",
    "    - *import mcstasscript.jb_interface as ms_widget*\n",
    "    - ms_widget.show(instrument) / ms_widget.show(data) shows widget interface for instrument / data\n",
    "    - ms_widget.SimInterface(instrument) needed if one wants to retrieve data made in an interface\n",
    "- Added instrument methods for moving and removing components (both explained in [instrument object page](../user_guide/instrument_object.ipynb))\n",
    "    - instrument.move_component\n",
    "    - instrument.remove_comopnent\n",
    "- Introduced error checking before writing / running McStas file, can be disabled with settings(checks=False)\n",
    "    - Checks all Component AT / ROTATED RELATIVE statements have valid targets\n",
    "    - Checks that variables used as component parameters have been declared\n",
    "- When using show_instrument in a notebook, a new tab was opened and it was shown in the notebook, changed it so no new tab is made when running in a notebook. If a new tab is desired use the keyword argument *new_tab* and set it to True."
